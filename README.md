uCommander - The Micro Commander
================================

This library simplifies interfacing with code written on
a microprocessor like an Arduino, Teensy, or similar devices
via serial communication.

The Python code is designed to work with the 
[uCommander Arduino library](https://github.com/aeetos/ucommander).

Most of the documentation you need to get started is currently 
hosted in that project, so that's your best starting point for now.

This module is not yet available in pypi (but we're working on it). 
Until then, to get started:
1. Install pyserial (ideally in a venv): `pip install pyserial`
2. Download or clone this project somewhere local
3. Navigate to the root of this project (same place this README file is)

After that, you should be able to run the cli as if the module was installed
via pip:
```
$ python -m ucommander -h
```
